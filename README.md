# Dallui App
- **Dallui App** is a **UI implementation challenge** built with **.NET MAUI**, targeting **net8.0-android** & **net8.0-ios**. This **cross-platform** app showcases a **polished user interface** inspired by an **AI Image generator concept**. While the app does not generate images, it serves as a platform to experiment with advanced UI/UX patterns, animations and localization.

## Development Highlights
The development of the Dallui App focused on creating an intuitive and engaging UI experience using .NET MAUI. Key highlights include the initial setup of custom fonts, images, and global styles, along with the integration of third-party libraries like CardsView.MAUI for dynamic card displays and CommunityToolkit.Maui for MVVM support. Additionally, localization was implemented through resource files, while Newtonsoft.Json facilitated configuration and data handling. Smooth animations were achieved using Lottie and SkiaSharp, enhancing transitions.
